    <p>
      The Pahiyas Festival is held every May 15 in Lucban, Quezon, to honor San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers. It is one of the most colorful and visually striking harvest festivals in the Philippines.

    <p>
      Homes are decorated with vibrant "kiping" (leaf-shaped rice wafers), fresh fruits, vegetables, and agricultural products to showcase a bountiful harvest and give thanks for blessings received throughout the year.

    <p>
      Tourists flock to Lucban each year to witness the creative displays, taste local delicacies like pancit habhab, and experience the joyful spirit of thanksgiving in Filipino rural culture.
