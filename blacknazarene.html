    <p>
      The Feast of the Black Nazarene is one of the most solemn and widely attended religious events in the Philippines, held annually on January 9 in Quiapo, Manila.
    </p>

    <p>
      Devotees clad in maroon shirts walk barefoot as a sign of humility and penitence, joining a massive procession called the "Traslación" that transports the life-size image of the Black Nazarene through the streets of Manila.

    <p>
      This event draws millions of participants and is known for its deep expression of Filipino faith, sacrifice, and fervent devotion to Jesus Christ.
