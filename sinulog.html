    <p>
      The Sinulog Festival is one of the grandest and most colorful festivals in the Philippines, held every January in Cebu City in honor of the Santo Niño (Child Jesus).

    <p>
      Participants clad in vibrant costumes dance to the rhythm of drums, trumpets, and native gongs in a lively procession that mimics the traditional Sinulog dance — two steps forward, one step back — symbolizing the Filipinos’ journey of faith.

    <p>
      A mix of religious devotion and cultural celebration, the Sinulog Festival draws millions of visitors every year, transforming the streets of Cebu into a dazzling display of unity, tradition, and joy.
