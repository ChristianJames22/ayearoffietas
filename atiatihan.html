    <p>
      The Ati-Atihan Festival is one of the oldest and most vibrant festivals in the Philippines. Held annually in Kalibo, Aklan, this celebration honors the Santo Niño (Holy Child Jesus) and features tribal dance, music, and colorful indigenous costumes.

    <p>
      Revelers paint their faces with black soot and wear traditional Visayan attire while dancing to rhythmic drumbeats through the streets — a tribute to the Ati people, the indigenous group believed to be the first settlers of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      More than just a religious celebration, Ati-Atihan has become a cultural icon of Filipino festivity, showcasing unity, faith, and joy among its people.
