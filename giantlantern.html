    <p>
      The Giant Lantern Festival, held in San Fernando, Pampanga, is a dazzling spectacle of lights and craftsmanship celebrated every December. The city has earned the title “Christmas Capital of the Philippines” because of this grand event.
    </p>

    <p>
      Barangays compete to build the biggest and most elaborate lanterns, which can reach up to 20 feet in diameter. These lanterns are lit using complex rotor systems that create kaleidoscopic effects and synchronized light shows.

    <p>
      The festival is a source of pride for Kapampangans and a symbol of Filipino creativity and joy during the Christmas season.
