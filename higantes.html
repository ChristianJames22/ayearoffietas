    <p>
      The Higantes Festival is a unique celebration in Angono, Rizal, held annually on November 23 in honor of Saint Clement, the town's patron saint and the patron of fishermen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its highlight is the parade of giant papier-mâché figures known as “higantes,” which stand up to 12 feet tall. These figures represent Spanish-era landlords and have become a symbol of freedom and local creativity.

      The festival also features processions, fluvial parades, street dancing, and the famous “basaan” (splashing of water for blessings). Higantes is a vibrant blend of history, satire, and art.
