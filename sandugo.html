    <p>
      The Sandugo Festival commemorates the blood compact (or “sandugo”) of Datu Sikatuna and Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565. This historic event is considered the first international treaty of friendship between the Filipinos and Spaniards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Celebrated in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, the festival features a reenactment of the blood compact, street dancing, beauty pageants, trade fairs, and cultural shows that showcase Boholano artistry and heritage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sandugo is both a celebration of peace and unity and a remembrance of a turning point in Philippine colonial history.
