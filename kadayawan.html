    <p>
      The Kadayawan Festival is a week-long celebration in Davao City held every August to express gratitude for the year’s blessings, including a bountiful harvest, peace, and the richness of indigenous culture.

    <p>
      It showcases the diversity and culture of Davao's 11 recognized tribes through parades, tribal dances, floral floats, and street parties. The word “Kadayawan” comes from the Mandaya word “madayaw,” meaning good or valuable.

    <p>
      It is one of Mindanao’s grandest and most colorful festivals, attracting both local and international tourists for its vibrancy and cultural pride.
